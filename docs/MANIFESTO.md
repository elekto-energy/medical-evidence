## Medical Evidence Platform

### The Problem

Current AI systems in healthcare suffer from:

1. **Hallucination** - AI generates false medical information
2. **No accountability** - Who is responsible when AI is wrong?
3. **No traceability** - Cannot verify what sources a response is based on
4. **Non-determinism** - Same question, different answers

### Our Solution

**EVE Medical Evidence** combines:

- 🧠 **AI Intelligence** - Understands questions, finds relevance
- 🔒 **Deterministic Core** - Every answer traceable, versioned, provable
- 👁️ **Witness Mode** - AI observes but NEVER recommends

### The Core Principle

```
AI CAN:     Observe, cite, summarize, explain
AI CANNOT:  Recommend, decide, advise, prescribe
```

### Why This Matters

In healthcare, incorrect information can cause harm.

We don't trust AI to make decisions.
We trust AI to **present evidence** so humans can decide.
